# To Do List
## Demo https://to-do-list-basic.netlify.app/

## Description:
<hr>
This is a basic Todolist web app. I did this in order to practice the basic of the front end development. 

For this app, I used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Why create this app ?
<hr>
As a new front end developer, I wanted to practice the basics. I will continue to do projects like this because, to me, this is the fundamentals. This one is my first project, it is not the better one of course but I like to keep it to remind me the beginning of this journey.
